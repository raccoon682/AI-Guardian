# AI Guardian Project

## Overview
The AI Guardian Project is a non-commercial, non-patented, and fully open AI infrastructure initiative to protect people from deception-based threats, such as fraud, misinformation, psychological manipulation, and information warfare.

## A Word from the Proposer
This concept was born to shield people from malicious information that causes real harm.
I am not a developer. I will not implement or oversee this project.
But I hope it grows into a shield that protects others.

If you become part of that shield, that is enough.

## Mission
- Deliver an open, intelligent defense mechanism to every member of society
- Implement an AI-powered shield against information-based crimes
- Safeguard vulnerable groups including the elderly, children, citizens, and public agencies

## Structure
The system is composed of three integrated components:

### Guardian Core (Central AI)
The central inference engine that learns linguistic and behavioral patterns of fraud, scams, and falsehoods. It provides alerts, explanations, and counter-dialogues.

### Guardian Sensor (Distributed Interface Agents)
Lightweight AI modules deployed on end-user devices (e.g., smartphones, messaging apps, browsers) to detect suspicious patterns in real time.

### Guardian Archive (Knowledge Base)
An open-access, continuously updated database of known fraud methods, misinformation patterns, psychological manipulation techniques, and social engineering tactics.

## Philosophy
- **Zero patents, open to all**
- **MIT License**: Permissive use in both public and commercial settings
- **Priority to non-profit and governmental deployment**
- **Only restriction**: No use for deceptive or coercive purposes

## Examples of Use
- Smartphone AI assistant alerts a user to a possible scam call
- Messaging app flags forwarded fake news with fact-checking links
- Government agency accounts detect coordinated misinformation campaigns
- Municipal platforms issue local fraud alerts in real time

## Call for Contributors
This project is in its early design stage. Due to technical limitations, the current maintainer cannot verify runtime functionality in Python environments.

We welcome contributions for:
- Implementation and validation
- Data collection and annotation
- UI/UX for community and public sector use

If you are interested in joining or supporting the project, please use Issues or Pull Requests to get in touch.

Together, let's build an intelligent shield for humankind.
